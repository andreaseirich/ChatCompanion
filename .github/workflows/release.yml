# GitHub Actions workflow skeleton for building and releasing ChatCompanion
# 
# This is a skeleton structure for future automation.
# Currently not fully functional - requires PyInstaller setup and release configuration.
#
# Future improvements:
# - Build PyInstaller executable for Windows, macOS, Linux
# - Create GitHub releases with downloadable executables
# - Automate version tagging
# - Upload artifacts to releases
