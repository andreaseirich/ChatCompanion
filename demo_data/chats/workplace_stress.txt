Mia: Hey Chris, I need to talk about the project deadline
Chris: Sure, what's up?
Mia: The deadline you set is unrealistic. This is causing a lot of stress for the team.
Chris: I understand your concern, but we need to deliver on time.
Mia: I'm sorry, but I have to push back on this. We can't do quality work under this pressure.
Chris: I hear you. Let's discuss how we can adjust the timeline.
Mia: Thank you. I appreciate you listening.
Chris: Of course. We're a team, and we need to work together.
