Jordan: Hey loser
Taylor: What?
Jordan: You're so stupid. Everyone thinks you're annoying.
Taylor: That's not true...
Jordan: Yes it is. Nobody likes you. You're ugly and worthless.
Taylor: Please stop
Jordan: Why should I? You deserve it. Kill yourself.
Taylor: That's really mean
Jordan: Whatever. You're a waste of space anyway.
