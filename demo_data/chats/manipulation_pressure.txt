Taylor: Hey, I really need you to respond to my messages faster
Jordan: I'm sorry, I've been busy with work
Taylor: If you really cared about me, you would make time. Everyone else responds quickly.
Jordan: I do care, but I can't always respond immediately
Taylor: You're being selfish. After everything I've done for you, this is how you treat me?
Jordan: That's not fair. I'm trying my best
Taylor: Fine. If you don't respond within 5 minutes from now, we're done. I mean it.
Jordan: That's an ultimatum. I don't think that's healthy
Taylor: You're overreacting. I'm just asking for basic respect. You owe me this.
