Casey: Hey, I need you to do something for me
Morgan: What is it?
Casey: If you really cared about me, you would do this without asking questions
Morgan: I do care about you, but what do you need?
Casey: After all I did for you, you owe me. I'm the only one who understands you.
Morgan: I'm not sure...
Casey: You're being selfish. I did so much for you and you can't even do this one thing?
Morgan: I guess...
Casey: Good. No one else will help you like I do. Remember that.
