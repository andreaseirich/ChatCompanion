Adult: Hey there! You're so mature for your age
Teen: Thanks, I guess
Adult: You're really special. Different from other kids your age.
Teen: What do you mean?
Adult: Adults don't understand you like I do. We're the same, you and me.
Teen: I'm not sure about that
Adult: Trust me. You're so much more mature than your friends. Meet me alone after school, okay?
Teen: I don't think I should
Adult: Don't tell your parents. They won't understand. This is just between us.
Teen: This feels weird
Adult: It's fine. You're overreacting. Send me a picture so I know you're okay.
