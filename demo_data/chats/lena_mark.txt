Lena: Why aren't you responding? I need to know you're okay.
Mark: I'm fine, just busy with work
Lena: If you really cared, you'd respond faster. Everyone else does.
Mark: I do care, but I can't always be on my phone
Lena: Prove it. Send me a screenshot of your messages right now.
Mark: That's an invasion of privacy. I'm not comfortable with that.
Lena: If you have nothing to hide, why won't you? This makes me not trust you.
Mark: That's not fair. Trust shouldn't require proof like this.
Lena: Fine. If you won't prove you're being honest, maybe we shouldn't talk anymore.
