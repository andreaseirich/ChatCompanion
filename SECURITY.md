## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ChatCompanion, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

### How to Report

You can report security vulnerabilities through one of the following channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/andreaseirich/ChatCompanion/security) of this repository.

2. **Email**: Contact the project maintainer directly (contact information available in repository metadata).

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Disclosure Process

We will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe
2. Investigate the vulnerability
3. Work on a fix if the vulnerability is confirmed
4. Release a fix when ready
5. Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

**Note**: We are a small project with limited resources. While we take security seriously, we cannot guarantee specific response times or timelines. We will do our best to address security issues promptly and transparently.

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The ChatCompanion application code
- Dependencies and their security implications
- Privacy and data handling concerns

### Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for security reporting:

- Issues in demo/test data
- Issues requiring physical access to the device
- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report to the respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks

## Security Best Practices

ChatCompanion is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **Fully Offline**: All processing happens locally; no data is uploaded
- **No Telemetry**: No tracking or analytics
- **No Persistence**: Chat text is not saved by default
- **Open Source**: Code is available for security review

We encourage security researchers and users to review the code and report any concerns.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (with their permission).
